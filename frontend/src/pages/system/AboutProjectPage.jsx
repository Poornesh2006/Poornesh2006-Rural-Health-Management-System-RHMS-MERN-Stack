    title: "Problem Statement",
    content:
      "Rural Primary Health Centres often depend on paper-based workflows that make patient history retrieval slow, duplicate registration common, queue management inefficient, and medicine, lab, and vaccination follow-up difficult to monitor.",
  },
  {
    title: "Proposed Solution",
    content:
      "RHMS digitizes patient registration, visit history, appointments, token queue, clinical consultation, pharmacy, laboratory, vaccination, analytics, referrals, and offline-first operational continuity in a single platform.",
  },
  {
    title: "Target Users",
    content:
      "Receptionists, doctors, pharmacists, laboratory technicians, health workers, facility administrators, district reviewers, and academic evaluators.",

    title: "Technology Stack",
    content:
      "React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Axios, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, Socket.IO, PDF/Excel exports, and Progressive Web App support.",
  },
  {
    title: "Expected Impact",
    content:
      "Faster record access, better queue visibility, improved follow-up tracking, clearer stock awareness, village-level reporting, and more reliable workflows in weak-connectivity environments.",
  },
  {
    title: "Limitations and Future Scope",
    content:
      "This project is an academic and demonstration system. Real-world deployment would require clinical validation, legal review, production monitoring maturity, and approved external health-system integrations.",
